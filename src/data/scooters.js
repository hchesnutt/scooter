      "description": "The Glion Dolly stands out for its portability. It folds up and then can be rolled like a suitcase (or dolly, hence the name), making it perfect for multi-modal scooter commuters to take on a bus or a train.",
      "negative1": "I think it\\'s an excellent value for someone who\\'s looking to travel a couple of miles every day and wants a quick commute.",
      "positive1": "Here\\'s where the Glion shines - the scooter stands vertically by itself. this is a huge plus if there is only standing room on the train. the short position on the handle is perfect to hold the scooter in place but also rest some weight on it.",
      "positive2": "The battery takes 3 hours or less to fully charge. This is a big deal cuz some scooters take 8-12 hours to charge.'",
      "positive3": "I keep up with most cyclists, and am even faster than a small handful."
