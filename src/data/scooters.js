    "negative2": "The tires on the L5 are flat, more like car tires in their surface profile than bike/motorcycle tires. As such they were happy when riding straight at lower speed, but as soon as you pass 12-15mph they become too twitchy for my liking.",
    "negative3": "I have had my L5 for a while now. Maybe 1300 miles. Front wheel came off. I felt a wobble and then it came off. I was soing about 15+ mph. Took a spill ripped my jacket and gloves. Thankfully I was protected.\n\nNot happy with the wheel breaking so easily. For the amount of money you pay. Should be sturdier, better made.",
    "positive1": "I love my L5! Going on 500 miles and not a lick of trouble. I commute on it daily and take it everywhere, inside grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops, light rail and buses, etc. etc. No one ever hassles me.

    "negative1": "Unfortunately, after 100+ miles, it started squeaking and creaking pretty loud, mostly around the shaft and shock absorbers. It was from the very beginning but became worse over time. Besides that, I have to check and tighten bolts and nuts once or twice per week, this really annoying.\n\nAnd today I found my self on halfway from home to work with a broken bearing in the front wheel.",
    "negative2": "I have the L5 Plus also and I am having issues in that the speed and distance recorded on the instrument cluster is not correct.",
    "negative3": "It has more torque than my other 4 scooters that I have to compare it too. the brakes, as I mentioned before are effective but a bit gnarly to get used too. I broke my wrist about 6 months back due to the fact that I wasn't used to the hard tug of the brakes at that speed and took a nice tumble. Learned my lesson and moved past it.",

Zippy enough to surf the streets on, just for the fun of it :-) Very happy with first few outings. Also like that owner/ user can do self maintenance and repairs.",
    "positive2": "This scooter is built like a tank. It’s able to get me to work (3 miles on a paved trail) oe 20-40% of a charge going 18-22mph the whole time. That’s pretty reasonable given I’m over 200lbs and the 20 mile range is rated around 12-15mph. I would appreciate a little more torque to help get up hills, but I don’t mind to help it out with a kick every now and then. Overall well worth the price",

However, the adjustment period was relatively quick and I got to fully experience what the scooter had to offer. The scooter is adept at conquering shitty NYC roads thanks to its suspension and pneumatic front tire. Because of this, I feel a lot safer riding the Touring than my ES2. "

Goped is known for being a higher end scooter and is light enough and \"compactable\" enough to pick up without hurting your back."

With that said, my front tire got a puncture in the first few days, and will say getting the tire back on once tube is repaired/replaced is a nightmare.

This is perfect for someone that is looking for a rig that is tough enough, fast enough and has the endurance for every day travel. I use mine for traveling to my various fly fishing destinations as well as running errands. It is on the heavier side, but manageable.",
    "positive2": "It's super stable, quiet, and easy to ride, while it also appears very durable.",
    "positive3": "The full suspension is awesome (must have for me) and having TWO disc brakes was essential as I've gotten over 40mph downhill. Not having two disc brake imo would be really unsafe, cuz this thing hauls azz.",

For the uninitiated, changing pneumatic tubes & tires around the scooter's hub motor can be a real pain. It can be difficult and it's easy to cause damage to the scooter tire/wheel or yourself in the process if you do it improperly. I got plenty of experience changing them with my last scooter and honestly didn't want to be bothered anymore. ",
